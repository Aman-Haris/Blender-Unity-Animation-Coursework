# F21GA-Coursework

The theme of the coursework that I have choosen is an investigative thriller based on the original book called "Yellow Lights of Death" by the author Benyamin.
The short summary of the book is as follows:
In a café by the seaside, two friends, Christy Andrapper and Jesintha, witness the murder of a young man. When Christy discovers that it was Senthil, his classmate from school, who had been shot, he tries to follow up on the investigation. But the police deny such a crime ever took place. The hospital to which Senthil’s body was delivered insists he died of a heart attack. Christy begins to suspect a conspiracy. Was he caught in the middle of a giant cover-up? How was his powerful family connected with it? As the mystery deepens, the story moves back and forth between the archipelago of Diego Garcia and peninsular India, delving into the very heart of early Christianity in India.

I have tried to create a intro for the above said book if it is made into a tv series or show. The intro is heavily inspired by the cover art that was designed for this book. I have tried to introduce my own elements into the intro design.
