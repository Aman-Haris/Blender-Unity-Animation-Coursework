The render folder consists of 5 individual models in blend format, which were appended together into a single blend file to render the final output image.
All the blend files, includes the model along the with the reference image which was used as a reference for the model design.
All the models are low poly objects and furthur explanation will be given below.

Bullet.Blend:
This file contains the bullet model.
I have modelled 3 different types of bullets, as I wanted to check which bullet model would match my scene. Basic modelling technique is used to model the bullet and materials properties is used to color the model.

Candle.Blend:
This file contains the candle model.
Basic modelling technique is used to model the candle. I have used the brush mode from the sculpting workspace to add the contours and depression on the candle to make it look more realistic.

Human.blend
This file contains the human model.
Basic modelling technique is used to model the human. As I was aiming to model a low poly object, I have modelled the object using a single cylinder and by extruding, scaling etc to shape various parts required. 

Revolver.blend
This file contains the revolver model.
This object was the toughest to model as I had to use and combine various shapes to create the final model. Again various modelling techniques such as extrduing, scaling, etc was used to create the model.

Text.blend
This file contains the title model.
For this model I tried a different approach in modelling the text. I used geometry nodes to create a 3D text for my show title. Various nodes such as 'String to curves', 'Set Position', 'Set Geometry' etc was used to model the final 3D text model.

Intro.blend
This file contains the final model for the intro. The various models stated above is appended into one single blend file to create the final rendered image. A black plane is used on which the models has been assembeled. A yellow colored plane is used to bring a design to the background plane. This plane would modelled into a path in the future. The candle object replaces the I in the text and a human object replaces the T in the text. There are 2 other humans walking on the yellow plane. On the right hand corner we can see a bullet being fired from the revolver. Colors of the objects is done from the material properties panel.
